# ag-grid-server-side-aspnetcore-example
AG Grid Server-Side ASP.NET Core 5 Example

# About The Project

As Ag-grid [Official docs](https://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid/server-side-model/#full-stack-examples) doesn't give us any example in ASP.NET Core, so I thought I can make the one example in the support of Dotnet developers.


## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

It is assumed the reader is already familiar with Angular Framework, ASP.NET Core, and T-SQL.

This example was tested using the following versions:

* angular/cli (v9.1.15)
* ag-grid-enterprise (v25.3.0)
* aspnetcore (v5)
* dapper (v2.0.78)
* dapper (v6.1.0)
* system.Linq.Dynamic.Core (v1.2.1.0)

### Installation

  `git clone https://github.com/imahmer/ag-grid-server-side-aspnetcore-example.git`
  
2 GoTo ClientApp and Install NPM packages
